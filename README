Libdmapsharing is a library which allows programs to access, share
and control the playback of media content using DMAP (DAAP, DPAP &
DACP). Libdmapsharing also detects audio AirPlay services; coupled
with the AirPlay support in PulseAudio or GStreamer, this can allow an
application to stream audio to an AirPlay device. The library presently
supports Linux and other POSIX-based systems. It is written in C using
GObject and libsoup. The DMAP family of protocols are used by products
such as Apple iTunes, Apple iPhoto, and the Roku SoundBridge family to
share media such as music and photos.
