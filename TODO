= Short term ===================================================================

Port to libsoup3.
	See https://libsoup.org/libsoup-3.0/migrating-from-libsoup-2.html.

	Clean up memory leak.

See notes about test-* in libdmapsharing/Makefile.am.

GNOME Bugs:
	344616: support database updates
	686220: play nicely with firewalld
	705539: confirm two share scenario fixed (seems to be in rhythmbox 3.0.2)
	727839: wierd startup warning
	705949: grilo

Noah: DNS-SD implementation
	Finish browser side support.

Documentation:
	Improve content (Noah?)
	Fix alignment of object description code
	Fix "up" icon in second level pages
	Add standard sidebar
	Improve aesthetics

= Mid term =====================================================================

Fix callbacks so that they do not provide a gpointer (see service-added
callback). They need to provide a proper GObject type (e.g., a new
DMAPMdnsBrowserService type) so that Python/GObject introspection works.

Noah: Comment purpose of each source file and describe interfaces, using test
programs as examples (Note: wait on doxygen vs. gtk-doc decision.

Mike: Realtime transcode: must g_input_stream_close what is returned from
daap_record_read, unless I change API (see also dmapd.c)

= Long term ====================================================================

Mike: Audit remaining GSoC patch:
--- dmap-db.c
--- dmap-share.c
--- dacp-player.c
--- dacp-player.h
--- dacp-share.c
--- dacp-share.h

Mike: Add support for browse= on DMAPConnection side to filter results (see dmap-share.c).

Mike: Functions that could be simplified:
	compare_record_property()
	apply_filter()/_dmap_share_build_filter() (lex/yacc?)

Mike: Add support for DMAP_CC_MSUP, dmap.supportsupdate

Something odd (as best as I can remember):
	TunesRemote+ on Android emulator
	Ryhthmbox on same machine
	Two network interfaces (i.e., _touch-remote._tcp listed twice by avahi-browse)
	Rhythmbox:
		Remote listed twice
		If "wrong" remote selected:
			entry_insert_text_cb has service_name set to garbled value
			mdns_remote_added has service_name set to correct value

Mike: Where to handle DACP-specific stuff in dmap-mdns-browser-avahi.c?

Mike: Does, e.g., handle_server_info need user_data parameter?

Mike: Replace dmap-md5.[ch] with GChecksum.

Mike: Ensure client test catches newly shared files?

Mike: Do transcode based on client?

Mike: Fix seeking.

Mike: Clean up test_dmap_server.
	Fix code that determines path of test.jpeg.

Mike: See FIXME's in dmap-share.c, daap-share.c, daap-record.c and dpap-share.c.
