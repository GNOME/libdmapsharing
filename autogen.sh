19 November 2010 W. Michael Petullo <mike@flyn.org>

	* Change Content-Type to consistently be application/x-dmap-tagged
	after getting a bug report from Michael Miceli. I confirmed that
	iTunes uses this content type (not application/x-daap-tagged)
	when sharing music.

	* Move over-anxious g_object_unref in _dmap_share_databases that
	resulted in corrupt DPAP thumbnails when using DmapdDMAPDbDisk.

18 November 2010 W. Michael Petullo <mike@flyn.org>

	* Fix problem sharing to iTunes due to incorrect Content-Length

	* Bump version number.

	* Don't set Connection: Close header in response to /databases/1/items (iTunes)

11 November 2010 W. Michael Petullo <mike@flyn.org>

	* Bump version number.

07 November 2010 W. Michael Petullo <mike@flyn.org>

	* Significant work on an interim solution for the problem
	of memory usage while building the "/1/items" response. We
	previously simply called foreach...add_entry_to_mlcl and later
	serialized the entire structure. This has the disadvantage that
	the entire response must be in memory before libsoup sends it
	to the client. Now, we transmit portions at a time.

31 October 2010 W. Michael Petullo <mike@flyn.org>

	* Bump version number.

24 October 2010 W. Michael Petullo <mike@flyn.org>

	* Fix _dmap_share_build_filter to support commas in values.

	is required to interact with Apple Remote App.

21 October 2010 W. Michael Petullo <mike@flyn.org>

	* Advertise support for dmap.supportsupdate even though we don't
	support it. This should fix DACP interaction with Apple Remote

16 October 2010 W. Michael Petullo <mike@flyn.org>

	* Add terminating record to meta_data_map in dpap-share.c.

	* Apply Alexandre Rosenfeld's DACP patch from Google Summer of
	Code 2010.

22 July 2010 W. Michael Petullo <mike@flyn.org>

	* Remove redundancy between dmap_connection_build_message()
	and dmap_connection_build_message().

	* Add dmap_db_add_with_id() to DMAPDb interface.

	* dmap_container_record_get_entries() must not return a const
	because the return value should be free'd.

01 June 2010 W. Michael Petullo <mike@flyn.org>

	* Unref value returned by dmap_container_record_get_entries().

	* Free strings returned by g_object_get().

25 May 2010 W. Michael Petullo <mike@flyn.org>

	* Refactor build_filter into dmap_share_build_factor.

	lookups.

	* Fix some declarations in dmap-db.c so that record IDs are
	always guint (vs. gint).

24 May 2010 W. Michael Petullo <mike@flyn.org>

	* Refactor DMAPShare, DAAPShare and DPAPShare to move code
	to DMAPShare and increase code reuse.

	bytes argument and returns a SoupMessageHeaders *. This is to remain
	compatible with Rhythmbox.

	* Fixed debug statement that caused segfaults of MIPS32 and
	PowerPC.
