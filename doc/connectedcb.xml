Once the DmapConnection object completes its interrogation of a DMAP
server, it will emit the "connected" signal. Libdmapsharing has fully

a simple "connected" callback which assumes db had previously been passed as the
third argument to dmap_connection_start:

	dmap_db_foreach (db, print_record, NULL);
