The DMAPMdnsBrowser class allows for asynchronous interaction with a DMAP
server using mDNS.

		<para>
The DmapConnection class's dmap_connection_start sets up a connection to a
DMAP server using libsoup, stores the application-provided callback, sets
the connection state to DMAP_GET_INFO, adds dmap_connection_do_something
as a GLib loop idle function, and connects the function _connected_cb
to the "operation-done" signal. The connection state progresses
from DMAP_GET_INFO to DMAP_GET_PASSWORD then DMAP_LOGIN then
DMAP_GET_REVISION_NUMBER then DMAP_GET_DB_INFO then DMAP_GET_MEDIA
then DMAP_GET_PLAYLISTS then (possibly) DMAP_GET_PLAYLIST_ENTRIES. Each
time the state changes, dmap_connection_do_something executes as an idle
function. By the time these state transitions are complete, DMAPConnection
has populated the media database. The _connected_cb function, in turn,
executes the application-provided callback.
